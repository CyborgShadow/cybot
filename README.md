# cybot
A Twitch bot coded in GoLang

## Prerequisites:

###Docker 
If you're unfamiliar with docker, [go here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)


I use a docker container with a prebuilt environment and lots of goodies to work in go.
To copy my dev repo, simply cd into the godev directory and run `./build.sh`, then `./run.sh`.
You'll create the container and be placed into it!
